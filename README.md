= wetselm

This repository contains a WETS simulator written in
[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

The software code and documentation are contained in a literate programming
document found in the `docsrc` folder. This is written in
[Asciidoctor](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/) and uses the
[atangle](https://repos.modelrealization.com/cgi-bin/fossil/mrtools/wiki?name=Aweb+Downloads)
application for extracting the code embedded in the document.
There are a number of dependencies for building which are listed in the
`docsrc` Makefile.
